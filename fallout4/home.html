            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The story of Fallout 4 focuses on a spouse, the Sole Survivor of Vault 111, as they search for their missing child, Shaun. Fallout 4 is set in and around the Boston area in 2287, 10 years after Fallout 3. Along the way, the Sole Survivor discovers a world in fear of a mysterious organization known as the Institute, consumed by paranoia of a race of robotic yet also biological human-like beings known as synths. As a result of the synth-focused narrative, the Sole Survivor, as well as the player, are faced with ethical questions such as how far people should experiment with science, the morality of creating sentient living machines that express emotions and suffering, and what it means to be human. </p>

        <h2>Pip-Boy</h2> <br>
        <p>Pip-Boys were standard equipment issued to all Vault-Tec Corporation Vaults. To register for such a device, residents would take part in an orientation seminar given by the Vault's Overseer to explain the functions and daily life enhancements provided by the Pip-Boy, along with filling out personal information in the Personal Information Processor Responsibility Form regarding such things as hand dominance, personal preferences, arm circumference, and vault jumpsuit measurements. Some Vaults received newer models of the device, while others were issued older versions. In addition, certain Pip-Boy models could support additions and equipment that other models could not.</p>

        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <p>The game takes place in The Commonwealth which is composed mainly of the former state of Massachusetts and is set heavily in the eastern portion of the state. The largest and central city of the game is Boston but also includes the surrounding towns and cities of Cambridge, Concord, Lexington, Malden, Nahant, Natick, Quincy, Revere, and Salem. Other real-world locations are represented in less detail, such as Bedford which has been replaced simply with Bedford Station. The game also includes some fictional towns, such as Sanctuary Hills where the game begins.</p>

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>A new equipment system allows a wide variety of upgrades and customization for weapons and armor. Unlike the previous two Fallout games, weapons and armor do not deteriorate with use and no longer require constant maintenance. Armor is now a split-piece system for different limbs such as left arm and right leg, allowing players to mix sets together. Power armor now requires batteries called fusion cores to ensure they run at full performance.</p>
